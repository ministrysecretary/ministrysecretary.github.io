<br>“‘For I well know the thoughts that I am thinking toward you,’ declares Jehovah, <strong>‘thoughts of peace,</strong> and not of calamity, <strong>to give you a future and a hope.”</strong><br>

<br>God wants people to <strong>enjoy life on earth forever! </strong>
<ul><li>He created man to live on earth and to <strong>find good</strong> in what they are doing!</li></ul>
 <br>Although we might have some bad days, God <strong>assures us that the future holds a lot of Good for us.</strong> 
<ul><li> you go about your day, remember that <strong>Everyday can be a good day thanks to God and Christ!</strong></li></ul><br>

<ul>
<li>Or <strong><h3 id="psalm"><a href="https://www.jw.org/open?pub=nwtsty&bible=19016011&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang">(Read Psalm 16:11)</a></h3></strong> </li>
</ul><br>

<strong>“You make known to me the path of life.</strong> In your presence is <strong>abundant joy</strong>; There is <strong>happiness at your right hand forever.”</strong><br>

<br><strong>Don’t you agree that life is confusing?</strong>
<ul><li>It has its own plots, scenes, and twists like movie play.</li></ul>
<strong>But wouldn't it be helpful for someone to help us navigate life, to help us when we need it?</strong>
<ul><li>Jehovah God provides us with a support system; his word the Bible! <strong>Through the Bible, God makes known to us the path of life,</strong> which will result in everlasting joy and happiness!</li></ul><br>

<li><h3 id="no">If there is <strong>“no or not a good time”,</strong></h3> then <strong> them to <a href="https://www.jw.org/en/">JW.ORG</a>:</strong></li><br>
            
“There are many articles and videos [for adults, teenagers, and kids] that strengthen our faith in the creator, and also help us to address day to day challenges that may occur. I highly encourage you to visit it!”
            </ol>
            
<h2 id="ok">If the response is: <strong>“I’m ok or not well”,</h2></strong> then say: <strong>Is there something that causes you to be concerned or overwhelmed?<br></strong>

<br><li><h3 id="fear">If it is <strong>Fear,</strong></h3> then <strong><a href="https://www.jw.org/open?pub=nwtsty&bible=23041010&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang"> (Read Isaiah 41:10,</a><a href="https://www.jw.org/open?pub=nwtsty&bible=23041013&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang">13)</a></strong> –</li><br>
    
<strong>“Do not be afraid, for I am with you.</strong> Do not be anxious, for I am your God. I will <strong>fortify you</strong>, yes, I will help you, I will really <strong>hold on to you</strong> with my right hand of righteousness.’ For I, Jehovah your God, <strong>am grasping your right hand</strong>, The One saying to you, ‘Do not be afraid. <strong>I will help you.’”</strong><br>
<br>When I feel afraid, I reflect on this scripture. 
<br>Jehovah God will <strong>grasp you, fortify you, and help you not to be afraid.</strong>
<ul><li>I encourage you that once we leave your door <strong>to pray to Jehovah, let him know your fears.</strong></li></ul>
<ol><li>When you <strong>persistently</strong> pray, you can receive the <strong>peace of God</strong> that guards our hearts and <strong>mental powers</strong>.</li></ol>
I will keep you in my prayers as well!<br>

    <br><li><h3 id="grief">If it is <strong>Grief,</h3></strong> then <strong><a href="https://www.jw.org/open?pub=nwtsty&bible=19034018&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang">(Read Psalm 34:18)</a></strong> –</li><br>

“Jehovah is <strong>close to the brokenhearted</strong>; He <strong>saves</strong> those who are <strong>crushed in spirit.”</strong><br>

<br>Jehovah God <strong>promises to support you</strong> when you feel sad. 
<ul><li>He can <strong>give you the strength to cope</strong> with your pain.</li></ul>
Remember this: <strong>Jehovah always understands how you feel!</strong>
<ul><li>Although we may think that we may have nothing good to look forward to, Jehovah will rescue you, and <strong>he has already provided you with something to look forward to!</strong><br></li></ul>

    <br><li><h3 id="anxiety">If it is <strong>Anxiety,</h3></strong> then share <strong><a href="https://www.jw.org/open?pub=nwtsty&bible=60005007&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang">(Read 1 Peter 5:7)</a></strong> –</li><br>

“while you <strong>throw all your anxiety on him</strong>, because <strong>he [Jehovah] cares for you.”</strong><br>

<br>Jehovah God is a <strong>true friend that truly cares for you</strong>
<ul><li>He can and will <strong>provide comfort</strong> and <strong>support</strong> to you.</li></ul>
All you need to do is call on him in <strong>prayer.</strong> 
<ul><li>Let him know everything that is on your mind.</li></ul>
<ol><li>Don’t just pray once but <strong>continually</strong>do so.</li></ol>
Be assured that he hears you and will in due time help you.<br>

<br>“Observe intently the birds of heaven; they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses, yet <strong>your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are?</strong> So <strong>never be anxious</strong> and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or, ‘What are we to drink?’ or, ‘What are we to wear?’ For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing. Your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. So never be anxious about the next day, <strong>for the next day will have its own anxieties. Each day has enough of its own troubles.”</strong><br>

<br><strong>Trust in Jehovah</strong> God, he places a high value on you, <strong>we are precious to him.</strong> 
<ul><li><strong>Don’t let anxiety paralyze you, use it as an opportunity to see Jehovah’s love and care for you!</strong><br></li></ul>

<br>“For God’s eyes are upon the ways of a man, And <strong>He sees all his steps</strong>. There is no darkness or deep shadow Where wrongdoers can conceal themselves.”<br>

<br><strong>There is no hiding from Jehovah God.</strong>
<ul><li>No impostor can fool him; <strong>no shadow is so dark or deep that God’s limitless vision cannot pierce right to the heart of matters.</strong></li></ul>
After Armageddon, then, we may look where the wicked used to be, but we will not see them. They will be gone​—<strong>forever!</strong><br>

    <br><li><h3 id="age">If <strong>someone is suffering due to Limitations imposed by illness or advancing age,</h3></strong> share <strong> <a href="https://www.jw.org/open?pub=nwtsty&bible=23040029&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang">(Read Isaiah 40:29-31)</a></strong></li>

<br>“He gives <strong>power to the tired one</strong> And full might to those lacking strength. Boys will tire out and grow weary, And young men will stumble and fall, <strong>But those hoping in Jehovah will regain power</strong>. They will soar on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary; They will walk and not tire out.”<br>

<br>I have some <strong>good medication</strong> for you. 
<ul><li>Do you pray to Jehovah to help you when you have no strength?</li></ul>
The apostle Paul suffered with weaknesses, but he said: <strong>“When I am weak, then I am powerful.”</strong>
<ul><li>The Holy Spirit can supply the <strong>power that you lack!</strong></li></ul>

While we might not regain physical strength like we had in the past, through the holy spirit we can have <strong>mental toughness and conviction in our Lord.</strong>
<ul><li>If the strength we have comes from Jehovah, <strong>we will be strong!</strong><br></li></ul>

    <br><li><h3 id="doubts">If they express <strong>doubts of self-worth,</h3></strong> then <strong><a href="https://www.jw.org/open?pub=nwtsty&bible=24031003&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang">(Read Jeremiah 31:3)</a></strong></li>

<br>“From far away Jehovah appeared to me and said: <strong>“I have loved you with an everlasting love.</strong> That is why I have <strong>drawn you to me with loyal love.”</strong><br>

<br>You are <strong>precious</strong> to Jehovah God! 
<ul><li>He values us, and <strong>wants you to be his friend!</strong></li></ul>
You just gotta <strong>accept</strong> his friend request. 
<ul><li><strong>Have you thought about drawing close to Jehovah?</strong></li></ul>
<ol><li>It means having a personal relationship with God!<br></li></ol>

<br>“When under trial, let no one say: <strong>“I am being tried by God.”</strong> For with evil things <strong>God cannot be tried, nor does he himself try anyone.”</strong><br>

<br>God does not try, or test, anyone by inciting him to behave badly.
<ul><li>God <strong>neither causes bad things to happen nor incites others to do what is bad.</strong> </li></ul>
Who or what, then, is to blame when bad things happen?
<ul><li>Satan is the <strong>ruler on this world, he controls the attitude and actions that this world displays.</strong><br></li></ul>

<br>“Accordingly, as God’s chosen ones, holy and loved, <strong>clothe yourselves</strong> with the tender affections of compassion, kindness, humility, mildness, and patience.”<br>

<br>We have to continue to show that we care for them no matter how much they hurt us. 
<ul><li><strong>Love can conquer any weakness of our imperfection.</strong></li></ul>
Pray to Jehovah and ask him to give you the <strong>mental capacity</strong> to endure and to return in love.<br>

    <br><li><h3 id="decision">If they are <strong>struggling to make a decision,</h3></strong> than share <strong><a href="https://www.jw.org/open?pub=nwtsty&bible=20021005&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang">(Read Proverbs 21:5;</a><a href="https://www.jw.org/open?pub=nwtsty&bible=20028026&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang"> 28:26)</a></strong></li>

<br><strong>“The plans of the diligent surely lead to success</strong>, But all who are hasty surely head for poverty. <strong>Whoever trusts in his own heart is stupid,</strong> But the one who walks in wisdom will escape.”<br>

<br>An <strong>impatient</strong> person usually undertakes things <strong>hastily, on impulse.</strong>
<br>Before making a decision, <strong>Research</strong> the pros and cons, <strong>pray</strong> about it.
<ul><li>Ask Jehovah to lean you into the right direction.</li></ul>
<ol><li>Diligently sticking to your plans is an important key to success.</li></ol>
Ask yourself: <strong>What decision will be made? Will it be a practical, reasoned-out one, or one according to this new desire of the heart?</strong>
<ul><li>If you are not very careful, the heart <strong>will overwhelm the mind</strong>. You will be motivated to follow a course against your better judgment.</li></ul>
Jehovah wants us to escape the disasters that result from trusting the treacherous human heart.  
<ul><li>He wants us to walk in wisdom, to trust in him as our wise Guide and Instructor.</li></ul>
When we do, our walk in life is secure, satisfying, and fulfilling.<br>

    <br><li><h3 id="others">If it is <strong>disappointment due to others,</h3></strong> then share <strong><a href="https://www.jw.org/open?pub=nwtsty&bible=23049015&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang">(Read Isaiah 49:15)</a></strong></li>

<br>“Can a woman forget her nursing child Or have no compassion for the son of her womb? Even if these women forget, <strong>I would never forget you.”</strong><br>

<br>It is difficult to imagine that a mother would forget to nourish and care for her nursing child. 
<ul><li>After all, an infant is helpless; night and day a baby needs its mother’s attention and affection.</li></ul>
<ol><li>Sad to say, however, maternal neglect is not unheard of, especially in these “critical times” characterized by a lack of “natural affection.”</li></ol>
Yet, Jehovah declares: “I would never forget you.” 
<ul><li>The tender compassion that Jehovah has for his servants is unfailing.</li></ul>
<ol><li>It is immeasurably stronger than the most tender natural feeling that we can imagine​—the compassion that a mother normally feels for her infant child.</li></ol> 
Little wonder that one commentator said of Isaiah 49:15: <strong>“This is one of the strongest, if not the strongest expression of God’s love in the Old Testament.”</strong><br>

    <br><li><h3 id="sins">If <strong>disappointment over their own sins,</h3></strong> then share <strong><a href="https://www.jw.org/open?pub=nwtsty&bible=19103012&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang">(Read Psalm 103:12)</a></strong></li>


<br><strong>“As far off as the sunrise is from the sunset,</strong> So far off from us he has put our transgressions.”<br>

<br>How far is east from west? 
<ul><li>In a sense, east is always at the <strong>utmost distance</strong> imaginable from west; <strong>the two points can never meet.</strong></li></ul>
<ol><li>One scholar notes that this expression means <strong>“as far as possible; as far as we can imagine.”</strong></li></ol>
David’s inspired words tell us that when <strong>Jehovah forgives, he puts our sins as far away from us as we can imagine.</strong><br>
